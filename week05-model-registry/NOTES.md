candidate_b: f1=0.932 (clears 0.70 bar)

## Which candidate reached Production, and why?

<!-- Which candidate ended up in Production, and why? -->


## Gating stale feature data

<!-- What would you need to add to promote_model's gate if you also wanted
     to block promotion of a model trained on stale (e.g. >30-day-old)
     feature data? -->


## Scaling the gate to 40 candidates

<!-- Tying back to this week's AutoML/HPO framing: if a hyperparameter
     search had handed you 40 candidates instead of 2, what in your
     register_model/promote_model design would need to change (or
     genuinely wouldn't) to gate 40 instead of 2? -->
