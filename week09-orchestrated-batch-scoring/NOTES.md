## notify retry count

<!-- How many attempts did notify take in your run? (Check
     dag_run_summary.json.) -->


## Branch independence

<!-- Why does load still succeed even though notify — its "sibling" in the
     DAG — failed on its first two attempts? What does that tell you about
     how failures in one branch of a DAG should (or shouldn't) affect an
     unrelated branch? -->


## Retry cost under FinOps

<!-- Tying back to this week's FinOps content: if notify were a metered API
     call you paid for per attempt, what would you change about the retry
     strategy, and why is "retry every failed task the same way" a risky
     default once cost enters the picture? -->
