"""
A tiny local DAG orchestrator — enough to demonstrate the two ideas from
this week's lecture without needing an actual Airflow install (a scheduler,
webserver, and metadata database is a lot of infra for a 110-minute
session):

  1. A DAG is a dependency graph of tasks, executed in an order that
     respects those dependencies (topological order) — not just top to
     bottom in the file.
  2. Individual task retry: a task that fails transiently should be retried
     some number of times before the whole DAG is considered failed, the
     same as Airflow's per-task `retries` parameter.

Fill in the three functions marked # TODO. The `Task` dataclass above them
is given.
